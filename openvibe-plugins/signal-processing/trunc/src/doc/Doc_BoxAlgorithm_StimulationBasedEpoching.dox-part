 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Description|
 The aim of this box it to select some signal near a specific event. The event
 is sent to the box in the form of an OpenViBE Stimulation. The author can
 configure the duration of the selected signal and the offset of this selection
 as regarding to the stimulation. For instance, it is possible to start the selection
 a few hundreds of milliseconds <em>after</em> the event, or even a few hundreds of
 milliseconds <em>before</em> the event.

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Inputs|
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Inputs|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Input1|
 This input should receive the signal that contains the epoch to extract.
 It is possible to pass either continuous signal or discontinuous signal.
 However, it is good to know how it is expected to work before trying to
 connect discontinuous signal.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Input1|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Input2|
 This input should receive the stimulation that triggers a new
 epoching. Any stimulation other than the one specified in the settings
 will be silently ignored.

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Outputs|
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Outputs|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Output1|
 This output will send the selected epochs of signal. This output
 stream is discontinuous by design meaning that successive epochs are
 not connected in time. It is possible to later re-epoch the output
 signals if needed.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Output1|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Output2|
 This output sends a stimulation at the begining of the selected epoch.

Settings description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Settings|
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Settings|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Setting1|
 This setting defines the duration of the selected epoch (in seconds). For instance,
 if you want to select 600ms of signal, you should enter 0.6
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Setting1|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Setting2|
 This setting defines the offset of the epoch as against the stimulation date.
 This is where the selection starts. If this offset is greater than 0, then
 the signal selection starts <em>after</em> the actual stimulation. If this
 offset is less than 0, then the signal selection starts <em>before</em> the actual
 stimulation. Refer to \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Miscellaneous for
 more detailed examples
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Setting2|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Setting3|
 This setting defines the stimulation identifier which should trigger
 a new epoching. Each time this stimulation is received, a new epocher
 starts and a new epoch should be sent.

Examples description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching_Examples|
 In the case of motor imagery, the user is usually instructed to imagine
 either left or right hand movement. This mental task typically runs for
 5 seconds. So selecting the signal block related to the imagination
 of left hand movement can be done with this box using the following
 parameters :
  - duration : 5 seconds
  - offset : 0 second
  - stimulation : OVTK_GDF_Left

 In case you'd want to avoid the first half second (because it could
 reflect a phase where the user is <em>starting</em> to perform the task)
 and wand to avoir the last half second (because it could reflect a phase
 where the user is exhausted and does not perform the taks optimally), then
 you could use the following parameters :
  - duration : 4 seconds
  - offset : 0.5 seconds
  - stimulation : OVTK_GDF_Left

<b>1. Continuous signal</b>

Suppose that we want to grab 1 second of signal following a specific stimulation code.
Suppose that the actual stimulation happens at <em>t=3.5</em> and <em>t=6</em>. Then the following figure
illustrate how epochs will be built. (<em>Ix</em> represents the x<em>th</em> input epoch and
<em>Ox</em> represents the x<em>th</em> output epoch)

\verbatim
         +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+
input  = | I1 | | I2 | | I3 | | I4 | | I5 | | I6 | | I7 | | I7 | | I9 | ...
         +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+
                                +----+           +----+
output =                        | O1 |           | O2 |                 ...
                                +----+           +----+

time   =      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9
stim   =                        ^                ^
\endverbatim

Suppose that we want to grab 3 seconds of signal begining 1 second before a specific stimulation code.
Suppose that the actual stimulation happens at <em>t=1.5</em> and <em>t=6</em>. Then the following figure
illustrate how epochs will be built. (<em>Ix</em> represents the x<em>th</em> input epoch and
<em>Ox</em> represents the x<em>th</em> output epoch)

\verbatim
         +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+
input  = | I1 | | I2 | | I3 | | I4 | | I5 | | I6 | | I7 | | I7 | | I9 | ...
         +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+
           +------------------+           +------------------+
output =   |        O1        |           |        O2        |          ...
           +------------------+           +------------------+

time   =      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9
stim   =          ^                              ^
\endverbatim

Overlapping epochs would also work as defined on the following example...
Suppose that we want to grab 3 seconds of signal begining 1 second before a specific stimulation code.
Suppose that the actual stimulation happens at <em>t=1.5</em>, <em>t=2</em> and <em>t=6</em>. Then the following figure
illustrate how epochs will be built. (<em>Ix</em> represents the x<em>th</em> input epoch and
<em>Ox</em> represents the x<em>th</em> output epoch)

\verbatim
         +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+
input  = | I1 | | I2 | | I3 | | I4 | | I5 | | I6 | | I7 | | I7 | | I9 | ...
         +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+ +----+
           +------------------+           +------------------+
           |        O1        |           |        O3        |
output =   +------------------+           +------------------+          ....
              +------------------+
              |        O2        |
              +------------------+

time   =      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9
stim   =          ^  ^                           ^
\endverbatim

<b>2. Discontinuous signal</b>

The case where input signal is not continuous (for instance, the signal has already been epoched with
either a \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_StimulationBasedEpoching or a \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_TimeBasedEpoching box)
can be tricky... Indeed, it is not possible to join input epochs correctly. The epoching only consists
in signal extraction from an individual input chunk.

For instance, suppose the following input signal (<em>Ix</em> represents the x<em>th</em> input epoch) :

\verbatim
         +------------------+        +------------------+        +-----
input  = |        I1        |        |        I2        |        |      ...
         +------------------+        +------------------+        +-----
time   =      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9
\endverbatim

Suppose that we want to grab 1 second of signal following a specific stimulation code.
Suppose that the actual stimulation happens at <em>t=1</em>, <em>t=2</em>, <em>t=4.5</em> and <em>t=6.5</em>. Then the following figure
illustrate how epochs will be built. (<em>Ix</em> represents the x<em>th</em> input epoch and
<em>Ox</em> represents the x<em>th</em> output epoch)

\verbatim
         +------------------+        +------------------+        +-----
input  = |        I1        |        |        I2        |        |      ...
         +------------------+        +------------------+        +-----
              +----+ +----+            +----+
output =      | O1 | | O2 |            | O3 |                           ...
              +----+ +----+            +----+

time   =      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9
stim   =      ^      ^                 ^             ^
\endverbatim

In this case, note that the last stimulation at <em>t=6.5</em> can not generate a valid epoch. Indeed, the input
signal does not cover the time period from <em>t=6.5</em> to <em>t=7.5</em> so no epoch should be generated.
