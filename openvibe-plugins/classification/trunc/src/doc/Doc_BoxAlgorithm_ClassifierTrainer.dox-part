Detailed description

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Description|
The <em>Classifier Trainer</em> box is a generic box for classification training purpose. It works
in cunjunction with the \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierProcessor box.
This box' role is to expose a generic interface to the rest of the BCI pipelines. The tasks
specific to a given classifier are forwarded to one of the registered \c OVTK_TypeId_ClassifierAlgorithm
algorithms. The behavior is simple, the box collects a number of feature vectors. Those feature vectors
are labelled depending on the input they arrive on. When a specific stimulation arrives, a training
process is triggered. This process can take some time so this box should be used offline. Depending on the
settings you enter, you will be able to perform a k-fold test in order to train a better classifier. When
this training stimulation is received, the box requests the selected classification algorithm to generate
a configuration file that will be useable online by the \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierProcessor box. Finally, the box releases a particular stimulation (OVTK_StimulationId_TrainCompleted) on its ouput, that can be used to trigger further treatments in the scenario.

Inputs description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Inputs|
This box can have a variable number of inputs. If you need more than two classes, feel free to add more
inputs and to use a classifier algorithm able to classify more than two classes.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Inputs|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Input1|
The first input receives a stimulation stream. Only one stimulation of this stream is important, the one
that triggers the training process. When this stimulation is received, all the feature vectors are labelled
and sent to the classification algorithm. The training is triggered and executed. Then the classification
algorithm generates a configuration file that will be used online by the \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierProcessor box.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Input1|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Input2|
This input receives the feature vector for the first class.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Input2|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Input3|
This input receives the feature vector for the second class.

Settings description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Settings|
The number of settings of this box can vary depending on the classification algorithm you choose. Such algorithm
could have specific input OpenViBE::Kernel::IParameter objects (see \ref OpenViBE::Kernel::IAlgorithmProxy for details). If
the type of those parameters is simple enough to be handled in the GUI, then additional settings will be added to this box.
For this to be applied, you will have to close & reopen the settings configuration dialog after the actual classification
algorithm is choosen. Supported parameter types are : Integers, Floats, Enumeations, Booleans. The documentation for those
parameters can not be done in this page because it is impossible to know at this time what classifier thus what hyper
parameters you will have available. This will depend on the classification algorihtms that are be implemented in OpenViBE.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Settings|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting1|
The first setting of this box is the classifier to use. You can choose any registered \c OVTK_TypeId_ClassifierAlgorithm
algorithm you want.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting1|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting2|
This setting points to the configuration file where to save the result of the training for later online use. This
configuration file is used by the \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierProcessor box. Its syntax
depends on the selected algorithm.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting2|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting3|
This is the stimulation to consider to trigger the training process.	
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting3|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierTrainer_Setting4|
If you want to perform a k-fold test, you should enter something else than 0 or 1 here. A k-fold test generally allows
better classification rates. The idea is to divide the set of feature vectors in a number of partitions. The classification
algorithm is trained on some of the partitions and its accuracy is tested on the others. The classifier with the best results
is selected as the trained classifier. See the miscellaneous section for details on how the k-fold test is done in this box.

This box is used in BCI pipelines in order to classify cerebral activity states. For a detailed scenario using this
box and its associated \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_ClassifierProcessor, please see the <b>motor imagary</b>
BCI scenario in the sample scenarios.

In this section, we will detail how the k-fold test is implemented in this box. For the k-fold test to be performed, you
have to choose more than 1 partition in the related settings. Suppose you chose \c n partitions. Then when trigger stimulation
is received, the feature vector set is splitted in \c n consecutive segments. The classification algorithm is trained on
\c n-1 of those segments and tested on the last one. This is performed for each segment. Then the classifier with the
best accuracy is choosen.

For example, suppose you have 5 parititions of feature vectors (\c FVs)
\verbatim
+------+ +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+
| FVs1 | | FVs2 | | FVs3 | | FVs4 | | FVs5 |
+------+ +------+ +------+ +------+ +------+
\endverbatim
For the first training, a feature vector set is built form the \c FVs2, \c FVs3, \c FVs4, \c FVs5. The classifier algorithm
is trained on this feature vector set. Then the classifier is tested on the \c FVs1 :
\verbatim
+------+ +---------------------------------+
| FVs1 | |  Training Feature Vector Set 1  |
+------+ +---------------------------------+
\endverbatim
Then, a feature vector set is built form the \c FVs1, \c FVs3, \c FVs4, \c FVs5. The classifier algorithm
is trained on this feature vector set. Then the classifier is tested on the \c FVs2 :
\verbatim
+------+ +------+ +------------------------+
|Traini| | FVs2 | |ng Feature Vector Set 2 |
+------+ +------+ +------------------------+
\endverbatim
The same process if performed on all the partitions :
\verbatim
+---------------+ +------+ +---------------+
|Training Featur| | FVs3 | |e Vector Set 3 |
+---------------+ +------+ +---------------+
+------------------------+ +------+ +------+
|Training Feature Vector | | FVs4 | |Set 4 |
+------------------------+ +------+ +------+
+---------------------------------+ +------+
|  Training Feature Vector Set 5  | | FVs5 |
+---------------------------------+ +------+
\endverbatim

Important things to consider :
- The more partitions you have, the more feature vector you have in your training sets... and the less examples you'll have to
test on. This means that the result of the test will probably be less reliable. But you will be able to choose the best classifier
among a more consequent list.
- The less partitions you have, the less feature vector you have in your training sets... and the more examples you'll have to
test on. This means that the online use of the trained classifier is more likely to be consistent with the trained classifier accuracy.

In conclusion, be carefull when choosing this k-fold test setting. Typical value range from 4 partitions (train on 75% of the feature vectors and
test on 25% - 4 times) to 10 partitions (train on 90% of the feature vectors and test on 10% - 10 times).
