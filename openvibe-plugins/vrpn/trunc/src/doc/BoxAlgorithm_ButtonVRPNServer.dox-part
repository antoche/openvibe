Detailed description

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Description|
 *
 * This plugin exposes several boolean states
 * to an external application thanks to the \e VRPN protocol. \e VRPN stands
 * for Virtual Reality Peripheral Network (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/).
 * It consists in a library that abstracts most used VR peripherals as
 * an aggregation of basic components such as \e analogic data, \e buttons
 * or \e trackers (localisation and orientation in space).
 *
 * The way §OpenViBE§ exposes these boolean states to
 * external applications consists in emulating a multi-button
 * device. The states are controled by stimulation streams and each
 * button can be pressed and released by given stimulation identifiers.
 * The number of buttons of the emulated device depends on the number
 * of input of the box. Each time an input is added, the corresponding
 * on/off stimulations are added to the settings of the box. Given this
 * behavior, any \e VRPN ready application is able to get parameters
 * from §OpenViBE§ and to provide feedback to the user as visual information
 * or whatever way the feedback should be done.

Inputs description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Inputs|
 * This box accepts unlimited number of inputs. Initial box only
 * has a single input but you can add as many \ref Doc_Streams_Stimulation
 * inputs as you want to the box.
 *
 * Note that in case you add inputs, the total number of button
 * of the emulated device will be the exact number of inputs, and
 * that the corresponding settings will be added automatically.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Inputs|
 *
 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Input1|
 * This input will receive a stimulation stream and change the corresponding
 * button state according to two stimulations.

Settings description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Settings|
 * Each input have a corresponding pair of stimulation codes that are
 * used to press or release a button. When the first stimulation is
 * found, the button switches to sate \e pressed. When the second one
 * is found, the button switches to state \e released. In case the
 * first stimulation appears while the button is already \e pressed,
 * nothing happens. Similarly, when the second stimulation appears while
 * the button is already \e released, nothing happens.
 *
 * If the on and off stimulation codes for a given button are the same,
 * then when this stimulation happens, the button state switches to \e pressed
 * and immedialty comes back to \e released. Client application will receive
 * the two state changes.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Settings|
 *
 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Setting1|
 * This setting contains the name of the emulated peripheral. This will be used
 * by the external application in order to connect to this peripheral. If this
 * setting is \e openvibe-vrpn and the machine running §OpenViBE§ is
 * \e openvibe-machine, then the complete \e VRPN peripheral name is
 * \e openvibe-vrpn\@\e openvibe-machine.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Setting1|
 *
 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Setting2|
 * This setting gives the stimulation code to track to switch button state to
 * \e pressed.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Setting2|
 *
 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Setting3|
 * This setting gives the stimulation code to track to switch button state to
 * \e released.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Setting3|

Miscellaneous description

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ButtonVRPNServer_Miscellaneous|
 * This box lacks an additional setting to specify the connection port.
 * Default \e VRPN connection port is \c 3883. But it may be possible that
 * you want to expose §OpenViBE§ on another port. This is not currently possible.
 *
 * For \e analogs emulation, you way want to look at the
 * \ref Doc_BoxAlgorithm_AnalogVRPNServer documentation that does almost
 * the same as this box but transcoding streamed matrices to analog states.
